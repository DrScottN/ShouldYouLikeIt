### Media literacy resources

We collect a few of the media literacy resources we've seen and used in building the extension:

[The NY DHSES 2025 literacy toolkit](https://www.dhses.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2025/01/2025-media-literacy-toolkit.pdf)
Basic definitions, an overview of the problem, and its own list of resources suitable for lesson planning and teaching K-12. 
(Speaking personally, some of the lessons are also fun for adults.)

[Crash Course Media Literacy](https://youtu.be/sPwJ0obJya0?si=fsxB5YvOKSs3iFjM)
The Crash Course series has created brief videos on a dizzying array of topics, all suitable for classroom use or for self-education. They also consistently provide sources in the comments. The media literacy series in particular helped inspire this project.


[Reel-control on micro-video](https://github.com/darajava/reel-control)
While not explicitly targetted at media literacy, this is another project that aims to directly change how social media interacts with you. Reel-control adds playback features and a progress bar to common micro-media content. (Note: not tested or endorsed.)

#### Acknowledgements
Thanks to OpenAI's o1 model for help with an early version and debugging. 
Code generated from the model was used as a first draft for the extension.
