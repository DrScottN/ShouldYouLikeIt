### Media literacy (and other related) material

We collect a few of the media literacy resources we've seen and used in building the extension:

[The NY DHSES 2025 literacy toolkit](https://www.dhses.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2025/01/2025-media-literacy-toolkit.pdf)
A teaching resource. Basic definitions, an overview of the problem, and its own list of resources suitable for lesson planning and teaching K-12. 
(Speaking personally, some of the lessons are also fun for adults.)

[Crash Course Media Literacy](https://youtu.be/sPwJ0obJya0?si=fsxB5YvOKSs3iFjM)
A teaching resource. The Crash Course series has created brief videos on a dizzying array of topics, all suitable for classroom use or for self-education. The media literacy series (from 2018) in particular helped inspire this project. Note additional sources in the comments of these videos. 

[Edutopia: evaluating information online](https://www.edutopia.org/blog/evaluating-quality-of-online-info-julie-coiro)
A teaching resource. Basic definitions, lesson outlines, and proposed interventions.

[The Triple Check](https://thetriplecheck.org/)
This is a (2020) social media literacy awareness campaign. They produced short videos, tweets targetting misinformation, and collected some news stories from the time.

[Paper: Shifting attention to accuracy can reduce misinformation online](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/3n9u8_v1)
A research paper finding that nudging people to care about truth, instead of social media metrics, can reduce the odds of them sharing misinformation. Of note, people seem able to tell when a headline is dubious, but that's not the question we ask first when reaching for the share button. See also the (1000+) papers citing this one. (I note in particular [Using LLMs in psych](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53d29678e4b04e06965e9423/t/6566e06ac95b0b61f8810a99/1701240942374/2023+--+LLMs+psychology.pdf), which suggests using LLMs to create and evaluate mis/disinformation interventions.)

[Article: The chronic growing pains of communicating science online](http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo0668?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D80545623092060248759220651474905468684%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1644539670)
An opinion piece on accurate scientific reporting online. In particular, arguing that spreading true information requires a change in social media; (science) communicators can't fix this themselves.

[Reel-control on micro-video](https://github.com/darajava/reel-control)
Software. While not explicitly targetted at media literacy, this is another project that aims to directly change how social media interacts with you. Reel-control adds playback features and a progress bar to common micro-media content. (Note: not tested or endorsed.)
